# Income-Prediction
This repository uses the data from [Kaggle-US Adult Income data](https://www.kaggle.com/johnolafenwa/us-census-data#adult-training.csv)

In this dataset Income is related to social factor's like Age, Education, Race etc.
This data has been extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 US Census Database.The data set consists of anonymous information such as occupation, age, native country, race, capital gain, capital loss, education, work class and more. Each row is labelled as either having a salary greater than ">50K" or "<=50K".

The goal here is to train a binary classifier on the training dataset to predict the column income_bracket which has two possible values ">50K" and "<=50K" and evaluate the accuracy of the classifier with the test dataset.

Since most of the plots that I made were using Seaborn and matplotlib, they are not rendered in the file so I'll show them here with the insights I got from them. Although you can find some plots that I made with matplotlib in the code file itself.
